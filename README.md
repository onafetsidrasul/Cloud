# Cloud Basic
## VMs cluster
The project start considering a VMs cluster of 3 machines: a master and 2 nodes.
## Benchmark
Several benchmarks are executed: HPCC, sysbench, IOZone and iperf.
To really stress the setup sysbench is executed also simultaneously with HPCC as IOZone with iperf.
## Docker cluster
After this a very similar Docker cluster is created and tested.
## Benchmark and comparison
The benchmarks carried on in this case are sysbench, IOZone and iperf.
## Conclusions
